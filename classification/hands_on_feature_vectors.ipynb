    "### Part 1:\n",
    "**Is your downsampling working properly? What can you observe on the spectrum of the downsampled signal? How is this phenomenon named and what is its origin?**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Rightarrow$  Yes, our downsampling is working properly, as for each M samples in the original signal, it only keeps one in the downsampled signal. We can observe that the downsample spectum doesn't match the original one. This phenomenon is called aliasing. It comes from the fact that as the signal is downsampled at a frequency $\\frac{f_s}{M}$ and therefore its spectrum is repeated at each multiple of this frequency, thus creating interference betwen each occurence of the spectrum. Using a low-pass filter to limit the maximum frequency of the signal to fulfil Shannon-Nyquist criterion avoids aliasing and will be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can you hear the differences between the downsampled versions of the audio signal and the original one?** \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Rightarrow$ We hear that the downsampled version of the signal has its high frequency content removed as it has passed through a low pass filter. This can be seen on the Fourier Transform above. For some signals, we can detect a diminution in the intensity of the sound. This might be avoided by normalizing the signal intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can also try sounds from different classes by running again the code above and changing the choice of the variable `sound`. Maybe you will notice there are two original and two downsampled signals shown. Can you guess why you have two signals? How to deal with this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Rightarrow$  Observing two signals is due to the fact that those can be stereo and not mono. We didn't observe it from the given files but it could happen during the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2:\n",
    "**What differences can you notice between the upper spectrogram and the two others at the bottom?**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Rightarrow$  The upper one (spectrogram of the full signal) has a frequency span of $20$ $[kHz]$ while the two bottom ones only show up to around $5$ $[kHz]$. This is due to downsampling. As we sample at a frequency of  $11.025$ $[kHz]$, by the Shannon-Nyquist theorem, we can only expect the maximal frequency of the sound we sample to be half the sample frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3:\n",
    "**Do these two spectrogram look similar? :)**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Rightarrow$  More or less, the position of the maximum stays similar but the intensity changes for some frequency. More importance is given to lower frequencies in the melspectrogram (i.e. it represents them better) as those are the frequencies that are the most distinguishable by human ear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the gain in the number of coefficients?**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Rightarrow$  $G = \\frac{stft.size}{melspec.size} = 12.8$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 5:\n",
    "**Observe their spectrograms and comment. Is it easy to differentiate sounds from the classes you chose?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main features of the spectrograms can help us differentiate the different classes of sound : \n",
    " - Frequency content.\n",
    " - Frequecy distribution over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain sounds are quite easily differentiable, but some others present similar features and the classification might involved. Moreover, certain sounds from the same class present very different spectrograms, and sometimes multiple classes are present in a sound. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Briefly comment what is intuitive for you in the content of these 3 spectrograms respectively with the corresponding classes. How can you differentiate them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire : usually emits very low frequencies, no particular periodicity (spectrogram should look \"constant\"), and the frequencies are distributed among a rather limited interval. However, crackling sounds may induce higher frequencies (only in certain sounds of the dataset), which could be quite hard to classify during classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Birds : higher frequencies, around 15 mel. As the chirping of the bird is not continuous, we should expect \"impulse\" patterns, such as the one observed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chainsaw : the frequency content is spread over a large frequency band with no particular distinguishable feature. It seems as though the sound of a chainsaw is filled with various frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handsaw : just like for the chainsaw, the frequencies observed on the spectrogram are quite spread out, but we can clearly observe the periodicity of the movement actioning the handsaw. This kind of strict periodicity could be a clear sign in our classification methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helicopter : as for the chainsaw and the handsaw, the frequencies are spread out, but the spectrogram contains more low frequency content as it will hardly ever exceed 10 mel"
